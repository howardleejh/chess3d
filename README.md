<h1>Howard's Chess</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This is my first project where I attempt to create a classic Chess game in both 3D and 2D. A couple of dependencies were used in the making, which included:

<br />

- [ChessboardJS](https://chessboardjs.com/index.html) by Chris Oakman
- [Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md) by Jeff Hlywa
- [Chessboard3.js](https://jtiscione.github.io/chessboard3js/index.html) by Jason Tiscione
- [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [Orbit Controls by THREE.js](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls)


<br />

There is still much improvement to be done, hence I'll continue to build upon this project to better improve some of the features and perhaps to add on more soon.
